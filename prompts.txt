Make 3 requests for me in postman.

3. get poll results 

Exemplo de requisições para Postman:

{
  "name": "Qual sua linguagem favorita?",
  "choices": ["Python", "JavaScript", "Go"],

Write on  test/main.py. Not use pytest, just a script that make this 4 requests in order and print True True True True

lets make another route. That will be asking for results of poll 
@vote_router.get("/vote/result/{poll_id}")
def get_result(poll_id: int) -> Dict[str, int]:
    result = {}
    for v in votes_db:
        if v["poll_id"] == poll_id:
            result[v["choice"]] = result.get(v["choice"], 0) + 1
    return result

But the identifier of user needs to be distinct, because now is counting twice for same user if voted twice
